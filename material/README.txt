Dear Pro/ENGINEER Users,

This set of material files has been provided by PTC Education Programs Group for use in PTC School programs. The 
material properties listed in each file were researched mostly from Matweb.com but also Wikipedia. We have done our 
best to ensure the accuracy of the information contained in each file, however, please check the material files you 
use to ensure the accuracy of the properties associated with them.

If you find any incorrect information or have any questions regarding the materials and their properties, 
please email schools@ptc.com.
